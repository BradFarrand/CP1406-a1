<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Bradley Farrand</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The client- Slammer's Beach Volleyball- have outlined what they want the website to achieve. The client primarily wants the website to facilitate greater exposure for the organization- quantified as a 50% increase in total registrations. The client also wants the website to help diversify the membership demographic within their organization by attracting families and younger members (ages 15-30). In order to appeal to other age demographics, promoting the message that Slammer's Beach Volleyball provides a varied range of services- as well as the social aspect of volleyball- is key.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The overall success of the site will be quantified by the amount of additional membership registrations at Slammers (goal set at 50), as well as the proportionate increase in members from younger demographics (ages 15-30).  </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The site has to strike a medium between the casual and the competitive; the younger and older demographics. Currently, Slammers biggest demographic are members between the ages of 35-50. The site should promote familiarity to maintain the current client base, as well as ease of use and excitement to attract younger demographics and new clients in general. The site needs to be designed in such a way that it promotes Slammers as offering a friendly atmosphere, competition, varied services and the opportunity for social networking- something for everyone. </p>
