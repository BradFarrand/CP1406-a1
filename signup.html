<h2>Playing Guidelines</h2>
	<p>Participants in Slammers Beach Volleyball play at their own risk. Anyone playing is responsible for their own        safety and should only play if they are capable. Check with your doctor before you begin.
       Game fees must be paid prior to the start of the game. Games may be cancelled by players up to 4 hours before hand       to get a refund. Without 4 hours' notice, participants will forfeit the game and be charged 50% of the game fee.    </p>
